Hike Messenger Hackathon App

I developed this application for learning more about Android Hardware API's and the Facebook API. What this app does is that it lets you login to your Facebook account and it will fetch all the information from your facebook account and displays it. That part is done using the facebook API. Then using the hardware API's it will show whether your phone is at rest or is moving, and also using the GPS module in your phone, it will give your phone's latitude and longitude. There is a lot of scope for improvement like I could add the Google Maps API to add more functionalities. I probably will do that in the near future.

I actually built this app for the Hikeathon - Hackathon by Hike Messenger competition
